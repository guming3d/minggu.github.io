Hello, I'm George. I build AI-powered systems and share hands-on notes, lessons learned, and experiments here.

This site is a mix of:

- Practical guides for AI/ML engineering
- LLM prompt + system design patterns
- Tools, libraries, and workflows I use
- Personal reflections on the journey

You can reach me via GitHub issues or PRs on this repo.
